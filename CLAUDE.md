# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

**Backend implementation is complete** based on specifications in TimeGrid Backend.md. The backend includes full API endpoints, database schema, authentication, and notification services. Frontend implementation is still pending.

## Project Overview

TimeGrid is designed as a PWA that combines calendar functionality with time blocking, task management, and offline-first capabilities. The application uses 15-minute increment time blocks with drag-and-drop functionality for time management.

## Planned Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Material UI (@mui/material) for components
- Zustand for state management
- @dnd-kit/core for drag and drop
- Vite as build tool
- vite-plugin-pwa with Workbox for PWA features
- IndexedDB (via idb) for offline storage
- date-fns for date handling
- Axios for HTTP requests

### Backend
- Node.js with Express
- PostgreSQL database
- MikroORM as ORM
- JWT authentication with bcryptjs
- web-push for notifications
- node-cron for scheduled tasks

## Documentation Files

The following specification files contain detailed implementation guidance:

- `TimeGrid Frontend PWA.md` - Frontend components, state management, PWA features
- `TimeGrid Frontend - Services.md` - API services, offline sync, notification handling
- `TimeGrid Backend.md` - API endpoints, database schema, authentication
- `TimeGrid - Utilities and Configuration.md` - Shared utilities, configuration, deployment

## Implementation Commands

### Backend (Implemented)
```bash
cd backend
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run dev          # Development server with nodemon
npm run build        # TypeScript compilation to dist/
npm start            # Production server from dist/
npm run migration:create  # Create new database migration  
npm run migration:up      # Run pending migrations
npm run migration:down    # Rollback migrations
```

### Frontend (Expected)
```bash
npm run dev         # Development server with HMR
npm run build       # Production build
npm run preview     # Preview production build
npm test           # Run tests
```

### Docker (Implemented)
```bash
cd backend
docker-compose up -d        # Start PostgreSQL and backend services
docker-compose down         # Stop all services  
docker-compose logs -f      # View logs from all services
```

### Environment Setup
```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env        # Copy and configure environment variables
# Edit .env with actual values for JWT_SECRET, VAPID keys, etc.
```

## Architecture Notes

- **Offline-First**: Uses IndexedDB for local storage with background sync to server
- **PWA Features**: Service worker for caching and push notifications
- **Time Blocking**: 15-minute increments as base unit for all time calculations
- **Hierarchical Tasks**: Tasks can contain subtasks with inheritance of properties
- **JWT Authentication**: Stateless authentication with refresh token rotation
- **Database Migrations**: Uses MikroORM migrations for schema versioning

## Backend Implementation Status

âœ… **Completed Components:**
- Express.js server with TypeScript
- MikroORM with PostgreSQL integration  
- JWT authentication system
- User management with bcrypt password hashing
- Task CRUD operations with hierarchical support
- Time block management with 15-minute increment validation
- Push notification service with VAPID
- Daily planning reminder cron jobs
- Database schema and migrations
- Docker containerization
- Comprehensive error handling and validation

## Development Workflow

1. âœ… Backend API endpoints and database schema (COMPLETED)
2. ðŸ”„ Implement frontend components following Material UI design system (PENDING)
3. ðŸ”„ Add PWA features (service worker, manifest, offline capabilities) (PENDING)
4. ðŸ”„ Implement drag-and-drop time blocking functionality (PENDING)
5. ðŸ”„ Add push notification system (PENDING)
6. âœ… Set up Docker containerization (COMPLETED)
7. ðŸ”„ Configure CI/CD pipeline (PENDING)

## API Endpoints (Implemented)

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/push-subscription` - Update push notification subscription

### Tasks
- `GET /api/tasks` - Get user tasks (filterable by status, priority, parentId)
- `POST /api/tasks` - Create new task
- `PATCH /api/tasks/:id` - Update task
- `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` - Delete task

### Time Blocks
- `GET /api/day-view` - Get time blocks for a specific date
- `POST /api/timeblocks` - Create new time block
- `PATCH /api/timeblocks/:id` - Update time block
- `DELETE /api/timeblocks/:id` - Delete time block

### Health Check
- `GET /api/health` - Service health status

## Key Implementation Notes

- âœ… All time calculations use 15-minute increments with validation
- âœ… Push notifications implemented with VAPID key configuration
- âœ… Database uses UUID primary keys for all entities
- âœ… API follows RESTful conventions with proper HTTP status codes
- âœ… JWT authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- âœ… Comprehensive input validation with express-validator
- âœ… Time zone support for user-specific time calculations
- âœ… Overlap detection for time block scheduling
- âœ… Hierarchical task structure with subtask support
- ðŸ”„ Frontend state management through Zustand stores (PENDING)
- ðŸ”„ Offline data sync capabilities (PENDING)
