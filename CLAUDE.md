# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

**Monorepo structure implemented with Yarn workspaces**. Backend implementation is complete with full API endpoints, database schema, authentication, and notification services. **Frontend is ~85% complete** with full navigation, UI components, error handling, and branding implemented. Core functionality is working with remaining tasks being PWA features and optimization.

## Project Overview

TimeBlocker is designed as a PWA that combines calendar functionality with time blocking, task management, and offline-first capabilities. The application uses 15-minute increment time blocks with drag-and-drop functionality for time management.

## Project Structure

This is a monorepo using Yarn workspaces with the following structure:
```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/          # Express.js API server (âœ… COMPLETED)
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/         # React PWA (ðŸ”„ ~85% COMPLETE)
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json      # Root workspace configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml # Multi-service Docker setup
â””â”€â”€ nginx.conf        # Production reverse proxy config
```

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Material UI (@mui/material) for components
- Zustand for state management
- @dnd-kit/core for drag and drop
- Vite as build tool
- vite-plugin-pwa with Workbox for PWA features
- IndexedDB (via idb) for offline storage
- dayjs for date handling
- Axios for HTTP requests

### Backend
- Node.js with Express
- PostgreSQL database
- MikroORM as ORM
- JWT authentication with bcryptjs
- web-push for notifications
- node-cron for scheduled tasks

## Documentation Files

The following specification files contain detailed implementation guidance:

- `TimeBlocker Frontend PWA.md` - Frontend components, state management, PWA features
- `TimeBlocker Frontend - Services.md` - API services, offline sync, notification handling
- `TimeBlocker Backend.md` - API endpoints, database schema, authentication
- `TimeBlocker - Utilities and Configuration.md` - Shared utilities, configuration, deployment

## Implementation Commands

### Monorepo Setup
```bash
yarn install            # Install all workspace dependencies
yarn dev                # Start both frontend and backend in development
yarn build              # Build both frontend and backend
yarn docker:up          # Start all Docker services (postgres, backend, frontend, nginx)
yarn docker:down        # Stop all Docker services
yarn docker:logs        # View logs from all services
```

### Backend Workspace
```bash
yarn workspace @timeblocker/backend dev          # Development server
yarn workspace @timeblocker/backend build        # Build TypeScript
yarn workspace @timeblocker/backend start        # Production server
yarn migration:create     # Create database migration (from root)
yarn migration:up         # Run pending migrations (from root)
yarn migration:down       # Rollback migrations (from root)
```

### Frontend Workspace  
```bash
yarn workspace @timeblocker/frontend dev         # Development server with HMR
yarn workspace @timeblocker/frontend build       # Production build
yarn workspace @timeblocker/frontend preview     # Preview production build
yarn workspace @timeblocker/frontend lint        # ESLint check
yarn workspace @timeblocker/frontend type-check  # TypeScript check
```

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Backend environment
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Edit backend/.env with JWT_SECRET, VAPID keys, database URL

# Frontend environment  
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
# Edit frontend/.env with API URL and VAPID public key
```

## Architecture Notes

- **Offline-First**: Uses IndexedDB for local storage with background sync to server
- **PWA Features**: Service worker for caching and push notifications
- **Time Blocking**: 15-minute increments as base unit for all time calculations
- **Hierarchical Tasks**: Tasks can contain subtasks with inheritance of properties
- **JWT Authentication**: Stateless authentication with refresh token rotation
- **Database Migrations**: Uses MikroORM migrations for schema versioning
